# An Introduction to Taylor's Theorem

So far, we've learned about differentiation and the derivatives of elementary functions such as $\sin(x),\cos(x),\log(x),\exp(x)$. Our goal today is to explore the following question:

What is the value of $\cos(1)$? 

By this I mean, can we calculate $\cos(1)$ to as many decimal points as we desire (given enough computational power)? It is well-known that $\cos(1)$ is a very non-algebraic[^1] number, so computing this is going to be quite tricky!
