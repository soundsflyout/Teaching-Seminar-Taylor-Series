# Exercises

Below are a few exercises to get you started. 
 1. Find the first three digits of $\cos(1)$. That is, $\cos(1) = a.bc\ldots$ (in decimal expansion). Find $a,b,c$ and prove that your values for $a,b,c$ must be correct. Hint: it is easiest (from worrying about carry over) to estimate $\cos(1)$ to within $1/10000$, but you could make a coarser estimate if you wish, as long as you can make a good argument for why your estimate works.
 2. how that $\cos(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(2k)!}x^{2k}$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. That is, show that the right hand side series must converge, and that the convergent value is $\cos(x)$. 
 3. Use Taylor polynomials for $\sqrt{1+x}$ to calculate the first two digits of $\sqrt{2}$.
